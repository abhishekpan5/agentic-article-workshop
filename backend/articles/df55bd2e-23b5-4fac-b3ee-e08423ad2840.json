  "feedback": "**Research Quality (Score: 6/10)**: The article presents a solid foundation of research, including some credible sources and statistics. However, it lacks the depth of 15+ sources and could benefit from more recent data and a wider range of expert insights. The statistics provided are relevant, but the article would be stronger with additional citations and a more thorough fact-checking process. \n\n**Depth & Substance (Score: 7/10)**: The article covers the topic well, but it falls short of the 3,500-word minimum requirement. While it includes actionable frameworks, the insights, while informative, do not offer unprecedented depth or unique perspectives that would distinguish it from other articles on similar topics. Expanding on the case studies and providing more detailed analysis would enhance the substance significantly.\n\n**Writing Quality (Score: 8/10)**: The writing is generally clear and engaging, with a compelling introduction. However, there are minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that detract from the overall quality. The structure is logical, but some sections could benefit from smoother transitions to improve the flow of ideas.\n\n**SEO & Discoverability (Score: 7/10)**: The article has a decent SEO structure with strategic keyword integration and optimized headings. However, it could improve internal linking opportunities and enhance the meta description for better discoverability. The potential for featured snippets is present but not fully realized.\n\n**Engagement & Virality (Score: 7/10)**: The content is shareable and presents discussion-worthy insights, but it lacks a strong emotional connection that could drive higher engagement. The conclusion and call-to-action are present but could be more compelling to encourage reader interaction and sharing. \n\n**Overall Recommendations**: To improve the article, consider the following: 1) Expand the research to include more sources and recent data; 2) Increase the word count to meet the minimum requirement and provide deeper insights; 3) Revise for grammatical accuracy and smoother transitions; 4) Enhance the SEO elements, particularly internal linking and meta descriptions; 5) Strengthen the emotional appeal in the conclusion and call-to-action to boost engagement.",
